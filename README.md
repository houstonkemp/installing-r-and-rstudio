# Installing R and RStudio

Hi, new HKer!

We're stoked you're going to be using R. Here's what you need to do if R and RStudio aren't yet installed on your computer.

## R

To download R, go to CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network. CRAN is composed of a set of mirror servers distributed around the world and is used to distribute R and R packages. Don’t try and pick a mirror that’s close to you: instead use the cloud mirror [here](https://cloud.r-project.org) which automatically figures it out for you.

A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are two to three minor releases each year. It’s a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions, which require you to reinstall all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse.

**It’s recommended that you install the current version of R into a folder called R, directly on your C drive, as below.**

As of writing, the current version of R is version 4.2.2.

## RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. Download and install it from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When a new version is available, RStudio will let you know. It’s a good idea to upgrade regularly so you can take advantage of the latest and greatest features.
